Starting at version `3.4.0` Contentz comes with a `init` command that could be used to generate a new website using Contentz.

To create a new website using Contentz run a single command:

```shell
npx contentz init
```

This will initialize a new website inside the directory you run the command. If you want to create it in another directory run the following command:

```shell
npx contentz init my-blog
```

This will create a directory `my-blog` and initialize the website there.

The initialize process will run the following steps:

- Create the directory if it doesn't exists.
- Create the directories `articles` and `pages`.
- Initialize Git inside root directory.
- Create a `.gitignore`.
- Create a `package.json` with the scripts `build`, `social`, `write`, `watch`, `dev` and `start`.
- Create a `README.md` with a basic documentation.
- Create a `config.yml` with the basic configuration of your website.
- Install Contentz as dependency.
- Install concurrently, husky, lint-staged, serve and watch as development dependencies.
- Build the website one time.

After that you are ready to access your website and start writing!
