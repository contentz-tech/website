import ReadNext from "contentz/src/components/read-next.js";

Since version 2.8.0 of Contentz it has support for displaying a suggestion of what to read next at the beginning of an article or page, ideal to create a serie of articles.

To configure that add the following metadata to the Frontmatter of an article or page.

```yml
next:
  title: Documentation
  path: /docs/
  description: Learn how to use Contentz to create optimized websites.
```

This will be displayed like the following widget:

<ReadNext
  title="Documentation"
  path="/docs/"
  description="Learn how to use Contentz to create optimized websites."
/>

☝️_That is the real component._

Suggesting what to read next is a great way to keep the readers engaged with your website.
